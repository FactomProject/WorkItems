WorkItems
=========

This project is for the work item management for the Factom project.  Work Item Management is a style of managing projects based on the simple observation that a project ships when all the tasks that have to be done are done.

So all the work items for the project should go here.  Bugs can be and should be created as issues on the appropriate projects. But they should be components of an Issue here, under WorkItems.

We are getting close folks!
